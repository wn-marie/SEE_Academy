# Fun Calculator

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator** project! This simple Python script allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—on two numbers.

## Features

- Prompts the user for two numbers (integers or decimals)
- Calculates:
  - Sum
  - Difference
  - Product
  - Quotient
- Displays the results in a clear format

## How It Works

1. **User Input**
   - You will be prompted to enter two numbers, one after another.
   - Both numbers accept decimals (e.g., 2.5, 7.0).

2. **Calculations**
   - The script computes:
     - The sum (addition)
     - The difference (first minus second)
     - The product (multiplication)
     - The quotient (first divided by second; make sure not to use zero as the second number!) 

3. **Results Display**
   - The script presents all four results in a readable format.

## Usage

1. **Make sure you have Python installed** (Python 3 recommended).
2. Copy the code into a file called `fun_calculator.py`.
3. Run the script with:
   ```
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```
4. Input your numbers as prompted.
5. View your results!

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 8
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 10.0
Difference: 6.0
Product: 16.0
Quotient: 4.0
```

## Notes

- The script does **not** handle division by zero. Enter a non-zero value for the second number to avoid errors.
- Modify the code for more advanced features (e.g., error handling, continuous calculations) if desired.
